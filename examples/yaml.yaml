# This YAML file demonstrates various YAML features.

# Top-level document start
---
# Explicit type tags, multiline scalars (literal and folded), sequences, mappings, anchors, merges, etc.

# Example of an anchor (&) and alias (*)
common_settings: &common
  version: 1.0
  enabled: true
  lists:
    - item1
    - item2
    - item3

# Using the alias to merge into another mapping
merged_settings:
  <<: *common
  additional_setting: "some_value"

# Example of a second anchor and alias
default_values: &defaults
  name: "John Doe"
  role: "Developer"
  email: "john.doe@example.com"

# Merged multiple anchors: merges from "common" and "defaults"
merged_user:
  <<: [*common, *defaults]
  details:
    age: 30
    location: "Remote"

# Explicit tags (yaml.org schema examples)
explicit_tag_examples:
  boolean_true: !!bool "true"
  boolean_false: !!bool "false"
  integer: !!int "42"
  float: !!float "3.14159"

# Demonstrating different block scalars
block_scalars:
  literal_block: | 
    This text
    will preserve
    line breaks
    exactly.
  folded_block: >
    This text
    is folded into
    a single paragraph
    with line breaks replaced by spaces.
    Blank lines, however, are used to start new paragraphs.

# Example of flow style for sequences and mappings
flow_style_example:
  flow_sequence: [apple, banana, cherry]
  flow_mapping: { name: "Jane Doe", occupation: "Engineer", active: true }

# Sequences containing mappings
users:
  - name: "Alice"
    role: "Designer"
    status: active
  - name: "Bob"
    role: "Tester"
    status: inactive

# Demonstrating special characters in keys
"special~chars@key": "This is valid"

# Empty mappings and sequences

empty_list: []
